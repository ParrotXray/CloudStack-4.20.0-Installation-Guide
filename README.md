# CloudStack 4.20.0 Installation Guide
## Requirement
- Support OS: Ubuntu 24.04
- Architecture: amd64, aarch64

Please enter the root environment first:
```bash=
sudo su
```
To install these packages, run the following command:
```bash=
apt install vim openntpd -y
```

## Quick installation
Using the shell
```bash=
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ParrotXray/CloudStack-4.20.0-Installation-Guide/refs/heads/main/cloudstack_install.sh)"
```

# Installation
## Install SSH
1. Install SSH by running the following command:
```bash=
apt install openssh-server -y
```
2. Configure the SSH configuration file by editing it with the following command:
```bash=
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
3. Append the following lines to the end of the file:
```
PermitRootLogin yes
KexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dss
HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss
KexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
```
4. Save the file and exit.
5. Restart the SSH service to apply the new configuration:
```bash=
systemctl restart ssh
```

## Configure Network
Before configuring the network, you need to install some required packages.

Run the following command to install `net-tools` and `bridge-utils`:
```bash=
apt install net-tools bridge-utils -y
```
This will install the necessary tools for managing network interfaces and bridges on your Ubuntu.

To configure the network, follow these steps:
1. Use the following command to get details about your network cards:
```bash=
ifconfig
```
Make a note of the name of the network card that you want to use for the network bridge.

2. Edit the network configuration file by running the following command:
```bash=
vim /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml
```

3. Modify the file as follows:
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    $NATNIC:
      dhcp4: false
      dhcp6: false
      optional: true
  bridges:
    cloudbr0:
      dhcp4: false
      dhcp6: false
      interfaces: [$NATNIC]
      addresses: [$LANIP/$CIDR]
      routes:
       - to: default
         via: $GATEWAY
      nameservers:
        addresses: [$DNS1, $DNS2]
      parameters:
        stp: false
        forward-delay: 0
```
In the configuration file provided above, you need to replace the following parameters with your own settings:
- **$NATNIC**: the name of your network card
- **$LANIP**: This should be replaced with the IP address you want to set. For example, **`192.168.4.100`**.
- **$CIDR**: This should be replaced with the subnet mask of your network card, expressed in CIDR notation. To calculate the CIDR notation from the subnet mask, you can use an online subnet calculator or consult the documentation for your network equipment. For example, if your subnet mask is **`255.255.248.0`**, the CIDR notation is **`/21`**.
- **$GATEWAY**: This should be replaced with the IP address of your network gateway. For example, **`192.168.0.1`**
- **$DNS**: Enter the DNS server IP address. For example, **`8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`**

**Notice: Misconfiguration may cause the remote end to fail to connect**

4. Save the file and exit.
5. Set correct permissions:
```bash=
chmod 600 /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml
chown root:root /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml
```
6. Check the configuration by running the following command:
```bash=
netplan try
```
If there are no errors, apply the configuration by running the following command:
```bash=
netplan apply
```
This will apply the new network configuration and configure the network bridges with the specified settings.

## Install NFS
1. Install NFS server and client packages by running the following command:
```bash=
apt install nfs-kernel-server nfs-common -y
```
2. Create the directories for NFS mounts:
```bash=
mkdir /export
mkdir -m 777 /export/primary
mkdir -m 777 /export/secondary
mkdir -m 777 /mnt/primary
mkdir -m 777 /mnt/secondary
```
3. Set NFS exports by running the following commands:
```bash=
echo "/export/secondary *(rw,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)" >> /etc/exports
echo "/export/primary *(rw,async,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)" >> /etc/exports
```
4. Configure the NFS kernel server settings by editing the configuration file with the following command:
```bash=
vim /etc/default/nfs-kernel-server
```
5. Append the following lines to the end of the file:
```
LOCKD_TCPPORT=32803
LOCKD_UDPPORT=32769
MOUNTD_PORT=892
RQUOTAD_PORT=875
STATD_PORT=662
STATD_OUTGOING_PORT=2020
```
6. Save the file and exit.
7. Enable the NFS server and restart it to apply the new configuration by running the following commands:
```bash=
systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server
systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```
8. Mount NFS shares by running the following command:
```bash=
exportfs -a
```
9. Set up automatic NFS mounting during startup by editing the /etc/fstab file with the following command:
```bash=
vim /etc/fstab
```
10. Append the following lines to the end of the file:
```
$LANIP:/export/primary    /mnt/primary   nfs defaults 0 0
$LANIP:/export/secondary    /mnt/secondary   nfs defaults 0 0
```
Replace **$LANIP** with the IP address you set up in `Configure Network` step 3.

11. Save the file and exit.
12. Finally, restart systemd and mount NFS by executing the following commands:
```bash=
systemctl daemon-reload
mount -a
```

# Enable UEFI booting for Instance
## Requirement
The host system **must be installed in UEFI mode**.

You can verify the current boot mode using the following command:
```bash=
test -d /sys/firmware/efi && echo "UEFI boot mode" || echo "Legacy BIOS boot"
```
## Configuration file
1. Configure QEMU by editing the `qemu.conf` file with the following command:
```bash=
vim /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
```
2. Find the identifier and uncomment, change or append to the configuration:
```
nvram = [
  "/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.fd:/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS_4M.fd",
  "/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.secboot.fd:/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS_4M.fd",
  "/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.ms.fd:/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS_4M.ms.fd"
]
```
3. UEFI related params information added in `uefi.properties` which is located `/etc/cloudstack/agent`
```bash=
vim /etc/cloudstack/agent/uefi.properties
```
4. Paste the specified content into the `uefi.properties` file
```
guest.nvram.template.secure=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS_4M.ms.fd
guest.loader.secure=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.secboot.fd

guest.nvram.template.legacy=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_VARS_4M.fd
guest.loader.legacy=/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.fd

guest.nvram.path=/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/nvram/
```
5. Restart the service using the following command:
```bash=
systemctl restart libvirtd cloudstack-agent cloudstack-management
```
6. Click on **"Infrastructure"** on the left side, then click on **"Host"** to enter this screen

![image]

7. Click on the host in use to enter this screen

![image]

8. Find **"UEFI supported"** below the **"Details"** section; if it shows true, it means the setup was successful

![image]

9. When creating an **"instance"**, enable **"Advanced"** mode and select **"UEFI"** as the **"Boot type"**

![image]


# Some Problem Solutions
